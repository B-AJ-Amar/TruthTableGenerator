# TruthTableGenerator

**TruthTableGenerator** is a tool that allows to generate a truth table.

## Usage
**Currently, there is only one method available, which is "run.py".However, in the future I will add more features and create a graphical user interface (GUI). **

### Operators and their representations:

- *negation*:  `'!'`, `'¬'`
- *logical disjunction*: `'+'`
- *logical nor*: `'↓'`, `-`
- *exclusive disjunction*: `'⨁'`,`'^'` , `'!='`
- *logical conjunction*:  `'.'`, `*`
- *logical NAND*: `'↑'`,`'/'`
- *logical biconditional*: `'='`
- *material implication*: CommingSoon

**Note**: you can use `';'` as a delemeter to write more than one expresion (ex: `'A ⨁ B ; C . D'`)
